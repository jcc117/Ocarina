Pass 1
	Simple classes
Pass 2 and 3
	Extended classes
Pass 4
	Class variables, class methods, sage methods
Pass 5
	Method variables, main method variables, method literal variables
Pass 6+
	var variables

Each sage gets a thread to do this to add to the symboltable
Each pass is done in lockstep

Rules:
	Conditionals must have booleans
	strings, numbers, booleans, and other strings can be concatenated, noting else
	no void type variables
	var types must be immediately assigned: var x; is not valid
	functions cannot have return type of var
	only 1 sage can have a main method
	to start debug only the main sage needs to contain 'debug', others will be ignored but breakpoints will be enabled
	method literals must be constant - for now
