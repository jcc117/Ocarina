Ocarina Syntax

Welcome to the guide to the Ocarina programming language! Ocarina is being developed with the intent of Java's and C's control over variables while cutting down on its wordiness.
The clean, easy to understand syntax style and use of white space by Python also heavily influences this project. The goal of Ocarina is to combine these two into something
where you can get the best of both words: the cleanness of Python with the speed and compilability of Java. This guide is set up as both notes for developing this programming language
and also as an instruction guide to teach others how to write it.
